#### In this data set we are trying to identify good and bad teams in major league baseball teamâ€™s season. We are assuming some of the predictors will be higher for good teams. We will try to predict how many times a team will win in this season.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(pacman)
library(here)

p_load(Hmisc, xlsx, xtable, knitr, scales, magrittr, tidyr, plyr, dplyr, 
       stringr, e1071, corrplot, knitcitations, bibtex, missForest,
       foreach, doParallel, stargazer, forecast)
```

### Exploratory Analysis:
#### 	We can observe the response variable (TARGET_WINS) looks to be normally distributed. This supports the working theory that there are good teams and bad teams. There are also a lot of average teams.
#### There are also quite a few variables with missing values. 
####	Amd,Some variables are right skewed (TEAM_BASERUN_CS, TEAM_BASERUN_SB, etc.). This might support the good team theory. It may also introduce non-normally distributed residuals in the model. We shall see.
